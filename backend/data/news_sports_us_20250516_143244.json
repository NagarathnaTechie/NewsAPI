            "full_content": "Celtics Jaylen Brown, Celtics show championship grit in Game 5 win over Knicks: Takeaways To stay alive, the Celtics needed a near-perfect game from Jaylen Brown, and they got one. Celtics guard Jaylen Brown drives to the basket during the second quarter in Game 5 against the Knicks at TD Garden. Danielle Parhizkaran/Globe Staff\n\nJaylen Brown and the Celtics aren’t yet ready to bow out into the postseason, claiming a 127-102 victory in front of an emotional TD Garden crowd on Wednesday.\n\nHere are the takeaways.\n\nPatient Jaylen Brown is an incredible basketball player\n\nTo stay alive, the Celtics needed a near-perfect game from Jaylen Brown, and they got one.\n\n“Near-perfect” for Brown doesn’t mean a huge scoring night, although he was excellent on that front – 26 points on 9-for-17 shooting, including three loud 3-pointers. His scoring unlocks the Celtics with Jayson Tatum absent, but we all knew that would be the case.\n\nThe rest of Brown’s game is what propelled the Celtics forward and kept their season alive. Brown was unbelievably patient on the offensive end – when he got into the paint, he forced nothing, instead kicking the ball out against a defense collapsing inward to try to prevent him from scoring. He wasn’t always rewarded with an assist – one of the Celtics’ best plays of the game started when Brown collapsed the defense and ended with Kornet sliding to the rim for an open pick-and-roll dunk several passes later. Still, he was rewarded plenty – he finished with 12 assists and came just two rebounds short of a triple-double.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nBut Brown’s biggest contributions may have come on the defensive end, where he took on the task of guarding Jalen Brunson and hounded the Knicks’ guard into a very tough game. Brunson finished with just 22 points on 7-for-17 shooting and he never got into the kind of game-breaking rhythm he used to give the Knicks the 3-1 advantage they enjoyed entering Wednesday’s game.\n\nJaylen Brown is playing is ass off — Danielle H (@danielleceltics.bsky.social) 2025-05-15T00:34:13.592Z\n\n“I thought his dive into the bench kind of changed the game for us,” Joe Mazzulla said. “There was other game-changing plays, but I thought that was one of them. So he was just great on all levels. Just took it upon himself to guard Brunson, set the tone, and he did that on both ends.”\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nWhen Brown is locked in on the defensive end against a superstar opponent, he’s one of the league’s premier 1-on-1 defensive menaces – quick, bouncy and strong with a laser-focus (a laser-focus that, at times, makes you wish he was that good off the ball as well).\n\nWhen Brown is patient on the offensive end, he’s often every bit as impactful as Tatum – an underrated passer at this stage in his career and an explosive scorer.\n\nWhen he puts those two things together, he can give an opposing team something to sweat about heading into a crucial Game 6.\n\n“Just be who I am, and I think that’s it,” Brown said. “Just be myself, come out, be aggressive, and get it done in multiple ways. It’s a team, we’ve always been a team. I’ve always preached team. I’ve done whatever to kind of push this team forward.\n\n“So whatever is needed on me, I’m excited to be able to facilitate in whatever role, so it could change each game, each night, defensively, offensively, but the goal is to just lead, just be myself.”\n\nJalen Brunson committed five fouls in the third quarter (and one in the fourth)\n\nThe Celtics kept building massive leads against the Knicks early in the series only to see them leak away like water cupped between two hands.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nWhat they hadn’t tried yet was getting Jalen Brunson to foul out, which probably isn’t exactly a sustainable strategy, but it worked incredibly well on Wednesday. Brunson committed five fouls in the third quarter as the Celtics pulled far ahead – including a couple of very unnecessary ones for fouls four and five – and he committed his sixth with 7:19 minutes remaining in the fourth.\n\nBrunson struggled against Brown’s aforementioned defense, and the Celtics attacked him repeatedly and patiently. That strategy has now worked against both Brunson and Towns at various times in the series, and as the Celtics look ahead to a Game 6 that few thought they would see, they will need to consider how they can make both players work as much as possible on the defensive end.\n\nLuke Kornet changed the game for the Celtics\n\nThe Celtics and Knicks were tied at 59 coming out of the break and appeared headed for yet another incredibly tight finish.\n\nThen a Celtics player took over, and if we gave you five guesses before the game as to “which Celtics player will take over in the third quarter,” we doubt you would guess it.\n\nLuke Kornet started the third quarter on the floor and his presence completely changed the game. He recorded five of his seven blocks in the period, clogging the paint and sending the Celtics the other direction repeatedly, and he pulled down five rebounds.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nOffensively, Kornet got plenty of help from Brown, Derrick White and Jrue Holiday, but the Celtics held the Knicks to 17 points in the quarter in large part because they could not get anything going near the rim.\n\nKornet finished shockingly close to a triple-double as well: 10 points, 10 rebounds and seven blocked shots. Expect to see him play a major role (and maybe even start) going forward.\n\n“He was unbelievable,” Derrick White said. “He came in and just seemed to always be in the right position. Seven blocks is crazy. He was unbelievable tonight and really stepped up when we needed him. He’s had a great season and was big-time for us tonight.”\n\nKornet, meanwhile, was surprised to find himself being interviewed after the third quarter.\n\n“You just sort of take it,” he said. “I unfortunately was a little tired and didn’t have my usual wit and charm.”\n\nKristaps Porzingis was the exact opposite\n\nGoing forward, the Celtics will also need to consider to what extent Porzingis can be part of the rotation – in stark contrast to Kornet, Porzingis played 12 minutes and was -12 in a game the Celtics won by 25 points.\n\nPorzingis simply doesn’t look healthy, the Celtics’ margin for error has never been smaller, and the case for Porzingis would be that he’s the Celtics’ best rim protector – a case that Kornet sent packing into the third row on Wednesday.\n\nAfter the game, Mazzulla provided a concerning update.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\n“He couldn’t breathe,” Mazzulla said. “He was available if absolutely necessary. So that was just a decision between me and him. He was having difficulties breathing, but he wanted to be out there, and if we absolutely needed him, we would have been able to go to him and rely on him.”\n\nDerrick White’s time to shine\n\nWhite is close to a star-quality player – not quite an All-Star, but certainly more than a role player on a team that largely needs high-quality role players when fully healthy.\n\nHowever, Tatum’s injury ensured that the Celtics won’t be fully healthy for the foreseeable future. On Wednesday, White was enormous: A game-high 34 points on 16 shots, including 7-for-13 from 3-point range.\n\n“I mean, our back’s against the wall,” White said. “It’s win or go home at this moment, so none of us want to go home. We understand that it’s only going to get tougher. We haven’t won anything yet, just gotta find a way to go to New York and win a game.”\n\nWhite’s 3-point shooting was excellent, but he also went to the free-throw line 11 times. With Tatum out, the ball will be in White’s hands much more, which is something of a silver-lining – White is a great decision-maker and plays a highly efficient brand of basketball.\n\n“It’s not like someone can step and do what JT does at the level he does it,” White said. “So we kind of have to play a little differently and just find ways to create offense, to rebound, just everything he does on the court. Everybody’s got to step up. We did that tonight, and we’ve got to try to find a way to win Game 6.”\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe Celtics showed their mettle. They shouldn’t be content with that.\n\nThe Celtics are a championship-caliber team oozing with playoff experience and championship-quality mental strength, which is what made it so stunning that they went down 2-0 at home against the Knicks in the first place.\n\nWednesday’s game wasn’t just a team fighting for pride after its star went down – the Celtics were the better, more fundamental team. They have now led the Knicks by 14 points or more in every game, and they’ve led by 20 or more in four of them. In two of those games, the Celtics shot their worst games all year, and on Wednesday, they built a 20-plus point lead without Tatum.\n\nThe Celtics should not consider Wednesday’s win a point of pride. In fact, now that it’s over, they shouldn’t consider it at all. They are unquestionably the underdogs and by far the less likely team to move on, but they are good enough to be thinking less about what they proved on Wednesday and more about what they could accomplish on Friday.\n\n“Four hours ago, we just had to win one game,” Mazzulla said. “Now, we just have to win one game. That’s just kind of how you have to look at it. So we’ve got to win one road game.”\n\nGame 6 tips off at 8 p.m. at Madison Square Garden."

            "full_content": "On Wednesday, the NFL released the 2025-26 regular season schedule. Fans of the Kansas City Chiefs should make plans for some late nights — and to plan two major holidays around football. Here’s what to know about the team’s 17 regular-season games.\n\nThe NFL doesn’t buy into ‘Chiefs fatigue’\n\nYou may have a friend or cousin living in another market groaning that the Chiefs have too many high-profile slots. Someone you’ve interacted with on social media might even swear off watching Kansas City in prime time for fear that a few seconds of the broadcast may feature a high-profile romantic partner of a certain tight end. Someone somewhere still clings to anger over perceived biased officiating, vowing to never tune in to the Chiefs — or possibly football in general — again.\n\nThe NFL appears ready to call the bluff of its most angry clients.\n\nVia early schedule leaks, we have known that the Chiefs would be visiting the Dallas Cowboys on Thanksgiving and hosting the Denver Broncos on Christmas night. The first third of the season, however, will feature Kansas City early and often.\n\nIn Week 1, the Chiefs will face the Los Angeles Chargers in Brazil on a Friday night. The event, which will air for free on YouTube, will almost certainly set a record for the most-streamed live event. Kansas City will then appear on two of the first six Sunday Night Football telecasts on NBC — traveling to face the New York Giants in Week 3 while hosting the Detroit Lions in Week 6. The Chiefs will also play a road game against the Jacksonville Jaguars on ESPN’s Week 5 edition of Monday Night Football.\n\nEven the first two Sundays with 3:25 Arrowhead Time kickoffs will have massive viewership. In Week 2, the Chiefs will host the Philadelphia Eagles in a Super Bowl rematch that will be nationally televised on FOX. The vast majority of the country will likely also see their CBS-affiliate broadcast the Chiefs hosting the Baltimore Ravens in Week 4 — outside a small sampling of markets likely getting the Las Vegas Raiders hosting the Chicago Bears.\n\nMany football fans may well be tired of seeing the Chiefs win. The league is betting, however, that many of the disillusioned will still tune in to root for Kansas City’s opponents.\n\nThe Chiefs likely have a brutal first half of the season\n\nA caveat in assessing the schedule should be that we do not know which teams will fail to take an expected next step, which teams will rise above meager expectations, and — most importantly — which squads will be blessed with optimal health. All things being equal, however, the Chiefs’ first nine games appear frontloaded with the best opponents.\n\nKansas City will play five of the other seven squads who advanced to the second round of last season’s playoffs in that span (a sixth, the Houston Texans, will subsequently visit Arrowhead in Week 14). With always tough divisional contests against the Chargers and Raiders mixed in, we may learn much about how the Chiefs will rebound from a disappointing Super Bowl loss over the season’s first half.\n\nKansas City will become well acquainted with the top of the 2025 NFL Draft\n\nFormer Penn State pass rusher Abdul Carter and Colorado’s two-way superstar Travis Hunter were widely considered the best players in last month’s draft. The Chiefs will first encounter both top prospects on the road during the first five games of the season, with Carter now a Giant and Hunter a Jaguar.\n\nLate in the season, the Chiefs will get their initial look the draft’s top selection, former Miami quarterback Cam Ward, when they visit the Tennessee Titans during Week 16.\n\nKansas City will also now face generationally talented former Boise State running back Ashton Jeanty — now a Raider — twice each season, beginning with a home contest in Week 7 before concluding the season by traveling to Sin City in Week 17.\n\nTime will tell on the rookies’ star power, but four of the draft’s top six selections will line up against the Chiefs in their first season."

Correspondent Gethin Coolbaugh reports.\n\nBy Wednesday, all seemed forgotten.\n\n“It’s an honor,” Sinner said in Italian as he and his parents arrived in a reception room of the Vatican’s auditorium. Holding one of his rackets and giving Leo another and a ball, the three-time Grand Slam champion suggested a quick volley. But the pope looked around at the antiques and said, “Better not.”\n\nLeo, a 69-year-old from Chicago, then appeared to joke about his white cassock and its appropriateness for Wimbledon, perhaps a reference to the All England Club’s all-white clothing rule.\n\nHe asked how the Italian Open was going. “Now I’m in the game,” Sinner said. “At the beginning of the tournament, it was a bit difficult.”\n\nSinner has a quarterfinal match on Thursday in his first tournament back after a three-month ban for doping that was judged to be an accidental contamination.\n\nHe will next face freshly crowned Madrid champion Casper Ruud. Sinner is attempting to become the first Italian man to win the Rome title since Adriano Panatta in 1976.\n\nDuring the audience, Angelo Binaghi, the head of the Italian Tennis and Padel Federation, gave Leo an honorary federation card.\n\n“We all felt the passion that Leo XIV has for our sport and this filled us with pride,” Binaghi said in a statement. “We hope to embrace the Holy Father again soon, maybe on a tennis court.”\n\nThe pope and Sinner posed for photos in front of the Davis Cup trophy that Sinner helped Italy win for the second consecutive time last year. Also on display in the room was the Billie Jean King Cup trophy won by Italy in 2024, the biggest women’s team event in tennis.\n\nEarlier in the week, after Leo’s first quip about not wanting to invite him, Sinner said it was “a good thing for us tennis players” that the new pope likes to play the sport.\n\nIn addition to tennis, Leo is an avid Chicago White Sox baseball fan.\n\nHis predecessor, Pope Francis, was a lifelong fan of Buenos Aires soccer club San Lorenzo.\n\n___\n\nDampf reported from Rome.\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

            "full_content": "The 2025 NFL regular season schedule was released on Wednesday night, and the Detroit Lions will kick things off at Lambeau Field, where they’ll take on their division rival Green Bay Packers.\n\nThe Lions and the Packers both made the playoffs in 2024, and each is considered a strong contender for the NFC North crown in 2025. But recent history has been on the side of Detroit, as the Lions have not only won the division title in back-to-back seasons, but they’ve also won six of their last seven matchups against the Packers, including winning the last three games in Lambeau Field.\n\nWith that in mind, it shouldn’t be too much of a surprise that the folks over at FanDuel Sportsbook have set the opening betting line at Lions -1.5 points.\n\nThe Lions saw both their offensive and defensive coordinators exit for head coaching positions this offseason, but the majority of the coaching staff returns, and the players on the roster are healthy, improved, and confident heading into 2025.\n\nLast season, the Lions swept the Packers without the services of their top three edge rushers, Aidan Hutchinson, Marcus Davenport, and Josh Paschal in both games. Additionally, Jameson Williams missed Week 9, while DJ Reader and Alex Anzalone were both unable to play in Week 14. All six starters are expected to be ready to go this offseason.\n\nBut the Lions aren’t just healthier; their roster and depth have also improved. In free agency, the Lions signed D.J. Reed to replace Carlton Davis and Grant Stuard to replace Jalen Reeves-Maybin, then added Roy Lopez, Avonte Maddox, and Rock Ya-Sin to strengthen their defense. They further strengthened the interior defensive line by drafting Tyleik Williams in the first round of the NFL Draft while also snagging Tate Ratledge as a potential Kevin Zeitler replacement. Additionally, Isaac Tesla gives the Lions yet another dynamic offensive weapon, Ahmed Hassanein adds more juice on the edge, while Georgia’s Dan Jackson and Dominic Lovett will bolster the Lions' special teams.\n\nWhile the Lions have focused their offseason on getting bigger and more athletic, the Packers spent their offseason getting a lot more athletic—investing in speedy linebackers in free agency while adding wide receivers and offensive/defensive linemen in the draft—and sacrificing bulk. This strategy should help them be more competitive throughout the season, but it’s also fair to wonder how this approach will play out against the Lions.\n\nWe’ll find out in Week 1."

            "full_content": "Get ready to watch plenty of the Commanders in 2025.\n\nAfter quarterback Jayden Daniels’ sensational rookie season that culminated in a deep postseason run, Washington is scheduled for a whopping eight standalone games in the coming season.\n\nWhile the Commanders will start the season with a 1 p.m. Sunday home matchup against the Giants, they’ll have their first primetime game in Week 2 when they travel to Green Bay to play the Packers on Thursday night.\n\nWashington will be heavily featured from Week 5 through Week 11, as the club will play the Chargers in Southern California for a 4:25 p.m. start time on FOX. Then in Week 6, Daniels will have his second matchup against 2024 No. 1 overall pick Caleb Williams on Monday Night Football.\n\nIn Week 7, the Commanders will host the Cowboys for another 4:25 p.m. start on FOX. Then it’s two primetime games in a row, with a Week 8 Monday night game at Kansas City followed by a Week 9 matchup on Sunday Night Football against the Seahawks.\n\nThe Lions come to town for a rematch of the divisional round in Week 10, slated for 4:25 on FOX. Then the Commanders go international, facing the Dolphins in Madrid for 9:30 a.m. start.\n\nAfter a Week 12 bye, the Commanders will face the Broncos on Sunday Night Football for another primetime matchup.\n\nThe franchise will have a pair of 1 p.m. Sunday starts for road games against the Vikings and Giants before a special standalone Saturday matchup against the Eagles in Week 16.\n\nFinally, the Week 17, Christmas Day game against the Cowboys is scheduled for a standalone slot at 1 p.m.\n\nThat makes eight standalone games with three more late-afternoon featured time slots for Washington’s 2025 schedule."

            "full_content": "When it comes to NFL schedule release videos, no one does it better than the Los Angeles Chargers. Unafraid to poke fun at every opponent, the Pittsburgh Steelers certainly weren’t spared. The Chargers’ 2025 schedule theme was made in Minecraft, and it has plenty of subtle jabs at Pittsburgh, which they will play in Week 10 during Sunday Night Football.\n\nFeaturing an old mine, the beginning of the clip features a sign that says “No Children Allowed.” Is that commitment to the bit or a subtle jab at WR George Pickens, whose drama and antics frustrated the Steelers enough to trade him away like so many difficult receivers in recent team history?\n\nEntering the mine shaft, signs point in two directions: “Contender” and “rebuild.” Pittsburgh finds itself awkwardly in between, wanting to win and break an eight-year playoff victory drought but clearly far away from true Super Bowl contenders. It’s football purgatory.\n\nThere’s even an Aaron Rodgers Easter Egg tucked away in the final frame, watching the Steelers fall off the end of the track. Left side of the screen.\n\nFinally, the most explicit joke of them all. A red sign that reads, “Warning Track Ends In 9’8,” a clear nod to a Steelers’ team always hovering in the 9-10 win range. Good enough for Wild Card contention, not great enough for a top seed, and never bad enough to land a blue-chip draft prospect capable of resetting and transforming the franchise.\n\nThe Steelers and Chargers met early last season, with Pittsburgh exiting with a victory. Los Angeles will look for revenge this year. Their roster features former ex-Steelers, including RB Najee Harris, CB Donte Jackson, and WR Mike Williams, who spent most of his career with the Chargers before being traded from the New York Jets to the Steelers midway through 2024.\n\nThe Chargers have certainly gone after players and teams harder than the Steelers in the past and overall, Pittsburgh got off fairly easy. Still, as far as the NFL goes, it’s as biting critiques as you’ll see from team-to-team. Compare that to Pittsburgh’s direction, a “Catching Bigfoot” theme that didn’t reveal the schedule until the very end. Not the team’s strongest showing."
