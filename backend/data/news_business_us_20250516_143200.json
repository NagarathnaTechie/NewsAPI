            "full_content": "In this article WMT Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nwatch now\n\nWalmart on Thursday fell just short of quarterly sales estimates, as even the world's largest retailer said it would feel the pinch of higher tariffs. Even so, the Arkansas-based discounter beat quarterly earnings expectations and stuck by its full-year forecast, which calls for sales to grow 3% to 4% and adjusted earnings of $2.50 to $2.60 per share for the fiscal year. That cautious profit outlook had disappointed Wall Street in February. Wall Street was also underwhelmed by the results Thursday, as shares closed slightly lower. Walmart also marked a milestone: It posted its first profitable quarter for its e-commerce business both in the U.S. and globally. The business has benefited from the growth of higher-margin moneymakers, including online advertising and Walmart's third-party marketplace. In an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said tariffs are \"still too high\" – even with the recently announced agreement to lower duties on imports from China to 30% for 90 days. \"We're wired for everyday low prices, but the magnitude of these increases is more than any retailer can absorb,\" he said. \"It's more than any supplier can absorb. And so I'm concerned that consumer is going to start seeing higher prices. You'll begin to see that, likely towards the tail end of this month, and then certainly much more in June.\" Walmart said it expects net sales to increase 3.5% to 4.5% for the fiscal second quarter, but declined to provide guidance for earnings per share or operating income growth because of fluctuating U.S. tariff policy. Here is what the big-box retailer reported for the three-month period that ended May 2 compared with Wall Street's estimates, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG: Earnings per share: 61 cents, adjusted vs. 58 cents expected\n\n61 cents, adjusted vs. 58 cents expected Revenue: $165.61 billion vs. $165.84 billion expected In the fiscal first quarter, Walmart's net income fell to $4.49 billion, or 56 cents per share, compared with $5.10 billion, or 63 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.\n\nRevenue rose about 2.5% from $161.51 billion in the year-ago period, but had a 1% headwind from lapping leap day in the year-ago period. Yet it marked Walmart's first quarterly revenue miss since February 2020. Comparable sales – an industry metric also known as same-store sales – jumped 4.5% for Walmart U.S. and 6.7% for Sam's Club, excluding fuel. E-commerce sales increased 21% in the U.S., marking the 12th straight quarter of double-digit gains. Global e-commerce sales jumped 22% year over year."

            "full_content": "Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange on May 14, 2025.\n\nThe S&P 500 climbed for a fourth session, adding to this week's rally after the U.S. and China agreed to temporarily slash tariff rates. Treasury yields also fell, providing a tailwind to stocks.\n\nThe broad market index rose 0.41% to end at 5,916.93, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 271.69 points, or 0.65%, and closed at 42,322.75. The Nasdaq Composite underperformed, slipping 0.18% and settling at 19,112.32.\n\nConfidence in the immediate outlook for stocks has strengthened in the wake of last weekend's talks between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese officials that appeared to stave off a short-term decline in economic activity and a ratcheting up in inflation.\n\nTech giants are putting up a strong showing week to date. Nvidia and Tesla are both up around 15% each, while Meta Platforms has added nearly 9% during the period. Amazon and Alphabet are up more than 6% and 7%, respectively. The Nasdaq Composite is higher by 6.6% this week, trailed by the S&P 500, ahead 4.5%, and the Dow, up 2.6%.\n\n\"This is a market that has shifted to cautious optimism, i.e., market sentiment has shifted toward measured optimism, as recession fears begin to recede and equity markets demonstrate underlying strength. However, a number of macro and micro risks continue to form a 'wall of worry' that investors must navigate,\" said Joe Cusick, senior vice president and portfolio specialist at Calamos Investments. \"The next phase will hinge on whether the current rally can broaden and sustain through the summer months, or whether it gives way to a healthy consolidation or correction.\"\n\nShares of Foot Locker surged almost 86% after Dick's Sporting Goods said it planned to acquire the retailer for $2.4 billion. UnitedHealth slid nearly 11% after The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar, that the Justice Department is probing the insurer. A UnitedHealth spokesman later told CNBC that the insurer has not been notified by the DOJ of the \"supposed\" investigation reported.\n\nTraders also assessed the state of the economy on Thursday, with an unexpected decline in wholesale prices last month. The producer price index for April declined 0.5% month over month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. Economists polled by Dow Jones forecast PPI would increase 0.3% on the month.\n\nRetail sales increased 0.1% in April, which matched consensus estimates, while industrial production numbers for April decreased slightly more than expected.\n\nBond yields slipped after the release of the soft inflation report. The 10-year Treasury yield slipped more than 8 basis points to 4.44%, while the rate on the 2-year note slid 9 basis points to 3.96%."

            "full_content": "The broader market indexes soared on Monday, May 12, in response to news that the U.S. and China would pause their reciprocal tariffs on most goods for 90 days -- a move that built on the momentum from the trade deal framework that the U.S. and U.K. revealed at the end of last week.\n\nAs of Monday's close, the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.41%) was down just 0.6% year to date -- an astonishing rebound considering the index was down by more than 15% on the year at the nadir of its sell-off in early April.\n\nWhile it's great to see portfolio balances recover, those gains will matter little if they are fleeting, and investors are likely wondering if this bounce is the real deal or a head fake.\n\nEither way, it's important to focus on quality companies during volatile periods. But here's why I think the worst of the 2025 stock market sell-off may be over, and what I'd recommend you do if the market keeps rallying.\n\nAn end in sight\n\nThere's no perfect science for knowing when a sell-off is about to start nor for gauging when one is over. But there are some simple indicators you can use to gauge market sentiment.\n\nThe simplest is the relationship between stock market sectors. When investors are optimistic about the outlook for the economy and corporate profits, growth-focused and cyclical sectors like tech, consumer discretionary, communications, financials, and industrials tend to do well. But when investors are fearful, then defensive and \"safe\" sectors such as utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare usually outperform the benchmarks.\n\nSimilarly, investors often turn to hard assets like gold during times of uncertainty. At one point in late April, gold prices were up by over 30% year to date while the S&P 500 was down more than 12%.\n\nAnother good indicator to watch is the CBOE Volatility Index, commonly known as the VIX. It measures the implied volatility of short-term options on the S&P 500. If investors are willing to pay more for a call option because they think the market will go up a lot in the short term, or a put option to protect against downside risk, then that will lead to higher volatility.\n\nThe VIX was at its lowest point of the year when the S&P 500 was near its all-time high in late February. Then, shortly after President Trump unveiled his global tariffs on April 2 (\"Liberation Day\"), the VIX spiked in lockstep with a massive sell-off in the S&P 500.\n\nIn the last few weeks, the VIX has been falling and the S&P 500 has been climbing, a combination that could signal that the worst of the sell-off is over.\n\nGreat companies can sell off for bad reasons\n\nThe last month and a half or so have been a great lesson on the pitfalls of getting caught up in stock market volatility and letting emotions drive your investment decisions. It also shows the degree to which the market despises uncertainty.\n\nThe steep tariffs that Trump imposed led to a host of countries imposing their own higher tariffs on U.S. exports. The escalating tensions put the U.S. on the brink of an all-out trade war. Corporate leaders didn't shy away from outlining the effects these tariffs would have on their businesses.\n\nFor example, Nvidia said it would be taking a $5.5 billion charge in its fiscal 2026 first quarter. Shares of Apple and Nike got crushed due to their exposure to China, both as a manufacturing hub and as a major market for sales.\n\nHowever, strong results from top tech companies in the recent earnings season were a reminder that much of the broad market sell-off was based on fears of an economic downturn that had yet to materialize.\n\nMicrosoft reported phenomenal results and reaffirmed its upbeat revenue and operating margin guidance.\n\nMeta Platforms ramped up its data center and artificial intelligence investments, and management forecast higher capital expenditures this year.\n\nAlphabet reported steadily rising revenue and high margins. It also raised its dividend.\n\nOutside of big tech, several companies saw their stock prices get crushed for the wrong reasons. For example, American Express reported excellent results and reaffirmed its full-year guidance. Its long-term investment thesis looks stronger than ever with the company expanding its network while displaying impeccable risk management. Yet the stock got clobbered, and its price-to-earnings ratio was compressed to bargain-bin levels.\n\nMicrosoft, Meta, Alphabet, and American Express are just some of the many examples of companies that were doing just fine even when trade war tensions were hot, yet their stock prices fell anyway.\n\nQuality wins in the long run\n\nMarket sell-offs can be swift and brutal. When your screen flashes red with no end in sight, it's easy to get caught up in fear.\n\nHowever, companies with strong balance sheets don't need to overhaul their capital spending plans just because new policies in Washington appear liable to throw a wrench in a few quarters of results. Investors can take a similar approach by not overhauling their investment portfolios based on factors that don't pertain to the underlying investment theses of their holdings.\n\nResisting the urge to take action can be difficult, but I've found that one of the best ways to handle volatility is to invest in a way that limits pressure.\n\nPressure can come in different forms. But some of the simplest ways to mitigate pressure are to invest with a long-term mindset with money that you won't need anytime soon. Also, stick to holding shares of companies that you understand and that have strong fundamentals. Lastly, accept that rough conditions can get worse before they get better.\n\nThe same approach applies when the market is going up. You can eliminate pressure on yourself by recognizing that you don't have to time the very bottom to buy, nor wait to buy stocks until you can get them at incredible prices. Even if you're feeling like you missed out on the bargain-bin prices from recent weeks, that's OK. The real wins come from investing in top companies and holding them over the long term, not from trying to capitalize perfectly on short-term periods of market volatility."

            "full_content": "Hackers behind a series of destructive, financially motivated cyberattacks against some of the U.K.’s largest retailers are now going after big American brands, Google said Wednesday.\n\n“Major American retailers have already been targeted,” John Hultquist, the chief analyst for Google’s Threat Intelligence Group, told NBC News.\n\nAt least three top British retailers have experienced cyberattacks in recent weeks. Marks & Spencer was forced to pause online orders for weeks. Hackers who contacted the BBC provided evidence of “huge amounts of customer and employee data” stolen from the Co-op Group. The third, Harrods, restricted some internet access at store locations, though a spokesperson told NBC News that it has not seen evidence that customer data was stolen.\n\nHultquist declined to name which American retailers the hackers may be going after.\n\nThe National Retail Federation, which represents thousands of companies including Walmart and Target, acknowledged the threat.\n\n\"U.S.-based retailers are aware of the threats posted by cybercriminal groups that have recently attacked several major retailers in the United Kingdom, and many companies have taken steps to harden themselves against these criminal groups’ tactics over the past two years,” Christian Beckner, the NRF's vice president of retail technology and cybersecurity, told NBC News in a statement.\n\nAs one of the world’s largest tech companies, Google sells services like cloud storage, networking and security protections to some of the biggest retailers in the world, providing it significant insight into how hackers operate.\n\nIt’s not yet clear if there is a technical reason for the hackers to target retail companies, such as a vulnerability in a shared industry software program.\n\nFor-profit hackers have in recent years proven adept at accessing the computer systems of major companies and profiting by holding data and entire networks for ransom.\n\nThe U.K. hacking campaign strongly echoes the one that shut down parts of some Las Vegas casinos in 2023. That led to MGM Resorts, the owner of the Bellagio and Mandalay Bay, shutting down some casino floors, leaving guests unable to access their rooms with keycards. The same hackers also broke into Caesars Entertainment, but Caesars, unlike MGM, promptly paid the hackers, and it did not experience widespread service outages.\n\nThat hacking campaign was notable as the first widely known collaboration between a group of young, largely English-speaking hackers who successfully gained access to high-level corporate accounts, and a Russian-speaking cybercrime group.\n\nThat same loosely affiliated group provided initial access to the British retailers and is now going after U.S. ones, Hultquist said. It appears to have largely avoided high-profile targets in the interim.\n\nThe casinos, as well as the Co-op Group and Marks and Spencer, were infected with ransomware, a type of malicious software that hackers install on critical systems to lock them up and steal sensitive information. They then demand a payment to either not exploit the information or for help making those computer systems usable again."
