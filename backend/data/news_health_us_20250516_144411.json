            "full_content": "Fatigue may linger for a year after a mini-stroke, especially in people with prior anxiety or depression. Even when physical symptoms vanish in a day, tiredness can stubbornly remain.\n\nA transient ischemic attack, or TIA—often called a mini-stroke—is typically seen as a brief blockage of blood flow to the brain. The symptoms, like slurred speech or arm weakness, usually disappear within a day. But new research suggests the impact may last far longer than expected.\n\nA study published on May 14, 2025, in Neurology, the journal of the American Academy of Neurology, found that many people who experience a TIA report lingering fatigue that can continue for up to a year. While the study doesn’t prove that the mini-stroke directly causes the fatigue, it reveals a strong link between the two.\n\nMore Than Just a One-Day Event\n\n“People with a transient ischemic attack can have symptoms such as face drooping, arm weakness, or slurred speech, and these resolve within a day,” said study author Boris Modrau, MD, PhD, of Aalborg University Hospital in Denmark. “However, some have reported continued challenges including reduced quality of life, thinking problems, depression, anxiety, and fatigue. Our study found that for some people, fatigue was a common symptom that lasted up to one year after the transient ischemic attack.”\n\nResearchers followed 354 individuals, with an average age of 70, who had experienced a mini-stroke. Each participant was tracked for a full year to monitor their recovery.\n\nTo measure their fatigue levels, participants filled out detailed questionnaires within two weeks of their stroke and again at three, six, and twelve months.\n\nFive Faces of Fatigue\n\nOne questionnaire looked at five different types of fatigue, including overall tiredness, physical tiredness, reduced activity, reduced motivation, and mental fatigue. Scores ranged from four to 20, with higher scores indicating more fatigue. Participants had an average score of 12.3 at the start of the study. At three months, the average score decreased slightly to 11.9, at six months to 11.4, and at twelve months to 11.1.\n\nResearchers looked at how many participants experienced fatigue, as defined as a score of 12 or higher. Of the participants, 61% experienced fatigue two weeks after the mini-stroke, and 54% experienced fatigue at each of the three other testing time periods at three, six, and 12 months.\n\nBrain Scans Don’t Explain It\n\nParticipants also had brain scans. Researchers found that the presence of a blot clot on a scan was equal between people with long-term fatigue and those without it, so this did not explain the reason for the level of fatigue.\n\nResearchers did find that previous anxiety or depression was twice as common in those participants who reported lasting fatigue.\n\nWhy Ongoing Monitoring Matters\n\n“Long-term fatigue was common in our group of study participants, and we found that if people experience fatigue within two weeks after leaving the hospital, it is likely they will continue to have fatigue for up to a year,” said Modrau. “For future studies, people diagnosed with a transient ischemic attack should be followed in the weeks and months that follow to be assessed for lingering fatigue. This could help us better understand who might struggle with fatigue long-term and require further care.”\n\nA limitation of the study was that while participants were asked to complete the questionnaires themselves, it is possible some responses may have been completed with assistance from relatives or caretakers, and this may have influenced responses, including those around fatigue.\n\nReference: “Long-Term Fatigue Following Transient Ischemic AttackA Prospective Cohort Study” by Birgitte Hede Ebbesen, Simon Grøntved, Jakob Nebeling Hedegaard, Søren P.

            "content": null,
            "full_content": "Poll Do you believe energy drinks pose a significant health risk to young people? Yes No\n\nWhat are the alternatives to energy drinks?\n\n\n\nSugar-sweetened drinks related to chronic kidney disease, says study\n\nA widely consumed non-alcoholic beverage has gained immense popularity among millions of young individuals, but recent studies have highlighted alarming links between energy drinks and multiple health issues, including heightened risks for heart and kidney complications, as well as anxiety disorders. These beverages, while often regarded as a quick way to boost energy and alertness, have been implicated in a range of negative health effects, such as insomnia, elevated blood pressure, debilitating headaches, and gastrointestinal discomfort.Energy drinks have exploded in popularity, particularly among the youth who survive on less sleep, with approximately 31% of young people in the UK reported to consume them regularly. Despite their ability to enhance focus and wakefulness, health experts are increasingly voicing their concerns regarding the potential dangers these drinks pose, especially to the younger population who are their primary consumers.Annabel Gipp, a registered dietitian and contributing writer for the British Dietetic Association (BDA) , has outlined the serious adverse effects associated with energy drinks, largely stemming from their high caffeine content.Gipp elaborates, stating, \"Increased caffeine consumption among children and adolescents leads to elevated blood pressure, disrupting sleep patterns, causing severe headaches, and inducing stomach disturbances. There are also self-reported instances of injuries linked to hyperactivity triggered by these drinks. \"In addition to these immediate effects, Gipp stresses the long-term implications: \"Adolescence is a critical period for bone development, and caffeine has been shown to hinder calcium absorption in the small intestine, potentially resulting in lower calcium deposition in bones. This detrimental effect is exacerbated when energy drinks are consumed in place of calcium-rich alternatives like milk.\"As per a comprehensive 2023 review published in the Nutrients journal, which analyzed 18 different reports detailing the adverse health effects tied to energy drinks among individuals under 18, it was found that nearly half of the incidents involved cardiovascular issues. These included serious conditions such as heart arrhythmia and arterial hypertension. Furthermore, neuropsychological problems accounted for one-third of the analyzed cases, while 22% reported kidney-related concerns.The findings indicated that pre-existing medical conditions played a role in 44% of the analyzed incidents. In fact, the researchers noted, \"Cardiovascular adverse health events were documented in 45% of the incidences, including alarming conditions such as cardiac arrhythmia, arterial hypertension, acute coronary artery vasospasm, and spontaneous coronary artery dissection.\" In some cases, the affected individuals had consumed substantial amounts of energy drinks over several days, while one notable incident involved a healthy adolescent experiencing significant cardiovascular repercussions after consuming only a moderate amount of caffeine (80 mg).Further illustrating the potential dangers, the study cited a case from 2011 involving a teenager who suffered from acute renal failure linked to energy drink consumption. The authors pointed to the high taurine levels in these products as a potential contributing factor, noting that \"approximately 95% of taurine is metabolized in the kidneys.\" They highlighted how the consumption of energy drinks might lead to arterial hypertension, metabolic disorders associated with sugar, and weight gain, all of which are recognized risk factors for chronic kidney disease.In addition to physical health impacts, a recent study published in the Public Health journal revealed a troubling correlation between energy drink consumption and mental health issues in children and young adults. The study analyzed data from 57 diverse studies encompassing over 1.2 million participants from more than 21 different countries, identifying significant associations with anxiety, stress, depression, and even suicidal ideation.Dr. Shelina Visram, a senior public health lecturer from Fuse, Newcastle University, and co-author of the study, expressed grave concern over these findings. \"We are extremely worried about the implications that energy drinks can lead to psychological distress and mental health challenges. These findings represent crucial public health issues that must be addressed promptly.\"For years, researchers have lamented the lack of regulatory action surrounding energy drinks, arguing that their widespread availability to children and adolescents is jeopardizing their health. Professor Amelia Lake, the lead author of the study, stated, \"Energy drinks are being marketed to children and young people as a means to enhance their energy and performance levels, yet our research indicates they may be causing more harm than benefit. \"She further noted, \"We have raised alarms about the health consequences of these drinks for nearly a decade, highlighting that they are sold to children as young as ten years old for prices as low as 25 pence—cheaper than bottled water.\" The growing body of evidence suggests that energy drinks pose significant risks not only to the mental and physical health of children and adolescents but also to their behavior and academic performance. Urgent action is needed to mitigate these risks and protect young individuals from the harmful effects of these products.Healthier alternatives to energy drinks include herbal teas, natural fruit juices, coconut water, and just plain water. These options provide hydration, essential nutrients, and a moderate energy boost without the negative effects of excessive caffeine or sugar. Additionally, foods like dark chocolate, green tea, and goji berries can also offer a natural energy boost.Incorporating regular physical activity and getting enough sleep are also crucial for maintaining steady energy levels throughout the day. Smoothies made with leafy greens, protein, and fresh fruits are another excellent way to stay energized naturally. For a quick pick-me-up, snacking on nuts, seeds, or a banana can provide lasting fuel without the crash.Staying hydrated is equally important, as even mild dehydration can lead to fatigue and reduced concentration.Limiting processed sugars and caffeine can help prevent energy spikes followed by crashes. Finally, managing stress through mindfulness or meditation can improve overall vitality and keep energy levels balanced.Focusing on a healthy diet is important. A nutrient-rich, low-sodium foods can reduce strain on the kidneys. Leafy greens like spinach and kale, packed with vitamins and antioxidants, promote kidney function, though portion control is key for those with compromised kidneys due to their potassium content. Berries, such as blueberries and strawberries, are low in potassium and high in antioxidants, helping to reduce inflammation. Fatty fish like salmon, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, support heart health, which is crucial for kidney function.Focusing on the diet that is good for the kidneys is another way to keep the organs healthy. Red bell peppers, cauliflower, cabbage, and onions are excellent low-potassium vegetables rich in vitamins, fiber, and antioxidants. Blueberries and apples provide natural antioxidants and help combat inflammation while keeping potassium and sodium levels in check.Eating a balanced diet, hydration, controlling blood pressure and blood sugar, limiting smoking and alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight are crucial for kidney health. Exercise is also important for maintaining overall health.Rather than valuing a limited time period of high energy through a harmful source, it's better to train your body to take energy from healthy sources and have a long run. Nourishing your body with wholesome foods helps stabilize energy levels, improve focus, and support overall well-being. Over time, these small, consistent choices lead to better resilience—both physically and mentally."

Infected insects can spread the deadly Usutu virus to blackbirds, raising fears for the famous songsters. New data shows Usutu has spread across much of southern England in five years, and has been linked to declines in some blackbird populations. Scientists are monitoring its spread amid warnings that mosquitoes and the diseases they carry may expand their range under climate change. \"We've seen that the virus has spread further than we thought it might do, and it's persisted,\" Dr Arran Folly of the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) told the BBC.\n\nGetty Images Culex pipiens, the common house mosquito, has been found to carry and transmit the Usutu virus\n\nScientists at the APHA in Weybridge, Surrey, have been tracking mosquito-borne diseases in wild birds for decades, amid warnings that climate change is turning Europe into a potential breeding ground for the insects. Longer summers, hotter temperatures and heavy rainfall are creating conditions for the nuisance insects to move into areas that were previously inhospitable to them. Until 2020, all results came back clear. Then, after the summer heatwave of that year, Usutu was detected in several blackbirds in Greater London. \"Blackbirds specifically are quite susceptible to the virus and since 2020 we've found a decline in blackbirds of approximately 40% in Greater London,\" said Dr Folly. \"It gives an indication that in the future we might get other viruses that are transmitted by mosquitoes emerging in the UK.\" Diseases such as Usutu are a growing threat to wild birds, amid a host of other pressures, including habitat loss, climate change and pesticide use.\n\nWhat is Usutu?\n\nUsutu virus was first detected more than half a century ago around southern Africa's Usutu River It has since spread around the world, reaching Europe three decades ago, and was picked up for the first time in the UK in 2020 Blackbirds are particularly susceptible to the virus, which can also infect horses and, from time to time, humans. The virus is regarded as generally of low risk to people, and there have been no human cases reported in the UK to date.\n\nThe latest data shows that Usutu has spread further than the scientists expected. It has now been detected in wild birds across much of southern England, at least as far west as Dorset and as far north as Cambridgeshire. How big a risk Usutu poses to wild birds is uncertain. The virus has been linked to mass die-offs of blackbirds elsewhere in Europe, though that doesn't seem to be the case in Britain. And the blackbird remains one of the commonest garden birds with numbers holding steady in many parts of the country, especially in rural areas, and in the north.\n\nGetty Images In May, blackbirds are nesting and rearing young, with fledglings eventually leaving the nest\n\nTo untangle the puzzle – and gather more data on blackbird numbers – the scientists have joined forces with the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO). They are calling for volunteers to count blackbirds in their gardens over the summer months to find out more about the comings and goings of the birds. Around now blackbirds are breeding and raising their young, frequently seen hopping along the ground and singing from the branches of trees on summer evenings.\n\nGwyndaf Hughes/BBC Lucy Love in her garden within metres of the sea near Selsey, Sussex\n\nLucy Love, a garden birdwatch ambassador for the BTO, knows the blackbirds in her gardens by sight and has grown fond of them. \"They're beautiful birds – intelligent, friendly and they have the most beautiful song with a lovely melodic tone to it,\" she explained. \"And we cannot lose them – they're a vital part of our ecosystem.\""

Full Story\n\nBy COLlive reporter\n\nA confirmed case of measles has been reported in the Williamsburg neighborhood, raising serious concern among local health professionals about the potential for a broader outbreak, particularly within the frum community.\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious viral disease that can lead to severe health complications, especially in young children. With dense populations and close-knit social networks, the risk of rapid spread in the community is significantly higher.\n\n“Nobody wants their child to get measles,” warned local Crown Heights physician Dr. Eli Rosen of the Crown Heights ODA, in a message to patients. Dr. Rosen stressed that if your child is unvaccinated or missing a booster, to schedule an appointment to get vaccinated.\n\nThe Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine is proven to be both safe and effective. Two doses—typically administered at ages 1 and 4—offer up to 97% protection against the disease.\n\nThis development comes as health officials continue to emphasize the importance of proactive prevention measures to avoid a repeat of past outbreaks."

            "full_content": "Your cup of coffee has health benefits, but it also interacts with some medications.\n\nCoffee may affect how a medication is absorbed, metabolized or removed from the body.\n\nAn expert shares the seven drugs, like asthma and cold medications, that interact with coffee.\n\nFor the majority of people, coffee is part of their daily routine. It provides the energy boost you need to kick-start your day (hello, caffeine!), and boasts potential health benefits as well. The only drawback to your morning cup of joe is that it may not mix well with certain medications, especially if you take them earlier in the day.\n\nThere are many different ways coffee may interact with some medications. “Coffee can alter how certain medications are absorbed, metabolized or eliminated by the body,” says Jennifer Bourgeois, Pharm.D. “It can speed up gastric emptying, causing the medication to move through your system before it’s fully absorbed. It also competes with medications that rely on liver enzymes like CYP1A2, potentially increasing or decreasing drug levels in the bloodstream.”\n\nDon’t worry, this doesn’t mean you have to give up coffee completely, but you may need to adjust the timing of taking your medications and sipping on your coffee. Read on to find out which medications an expert warns may interact with your morning cup of joe.\n\n1. Antidepressants\n\nIf your doctor has prescribed an antidepressant, you’ll want to make sure you aren’t drinking coffee too soon after taking one of these medications because it can make them not work as well as they’re supposed to. For example, the caffeine in coffee can form a complex with the antidepressant drug escitalopram (Lexapro), making it harder for your body to absorb the medication. Since less of the drug is absorbed, it may be less effective.\n\nOther antidepressants like clomipramine and imipramine are broken down by the same enzyme (called CYP1A2) as caffeine. So if you’re taking these medications with coffee, they may not be metabolized as quickly, which can lead to higher levels of the drug in your blood for a longer period. On the other hand, this interaction could increase the effects of caffeine, leaving you feeling jittery and restless.\n\n2. Thyroid Medication\n\nHypothyroidism is a condition where your thyroid (a butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck) doesn’t produce enough thyroid hormones. Without adequate hormone levels, you may start to experience excessive tiredness, joint and muscle pain, depression or weight gain.\n\nBourgeois explains that the absorption of levothyroxine, used to treat hypothyroidism, can be significantly reduced by coffee. In fact, some studies found that it reduces your absorption of the medication by as much as 50%. “This may lead to inconsistent thyroid levels and persistent symptoms like fatigue or brain fog,” says Bourgeois. “That’s why patients are advised to wait 30 to 60 minutes before drinking coffee after taking thyroid medications.”\n\n3. Osteoporosis Medication\n\nMedications used to treat osteoporosis, like risedronate and alendronate, shouldn’t be taken with coffee. “Whether it’s caffeinated, decaf or even just milk or juice, these can all reduce absorption due to how the medication binds and dissolves. The safest practice is always to take this medication with plain water only,” says Bourgeois.,\n\n4. Cold & Allergy Medications\n\nPseudoephedrine (Sudafed) is a nasal decongestant that can be purchased over the counter to help treat a stuffy nose from the common cold or allergies. Like caffeine, pseudoephedrine is also a stimulant. So when taken together with coffee, it may compound the side effects, making you feel more jittery and restless. Those with diabetes should be extra cautious when consuming caffeine on this medication—some studies found that combining the two can raise blood sugar and increase body temperature.\n\n5. Antipsychotic Medication\n\nPeople who take antipsychotic medications like phenothiazine, clozapine, haloperidol or olanzapine may need to adjust the timing of their morning coffee. Coffee can interfere with your body’s ability to metabolize these medications.\n\nFor example, clozapine competes with coffee to be broken down by liver enzymes. If the medication can’t be metabolized, it becomes less efficient. A study found that the plasma concentration of clozapine was increased by 97% after taking it with 2 to 3 cups of coffee (about 400 milligrams of caffeine).\n\n6. Asthma Medication\n\nIf you have asthma, a condition that can make your airways inflamed and irritated, your health care provider may prescribe a bronchodilator like aminophylline or theophylline. These medications relax the muscles in your airways, making it easier to breathe. Common side effects of this medication include nausea, headache, restlessness and irritability. Consuming too much caffeine (from coffee, tea or energy drinks) can increase the side effects you may experience while taking this medication.,\n\n7. Blood Thinners\n\nBlood-thinning medications are often recommended for those who may be at risk for blood clots after surgery or have certain heart or blood conditions. Since these medications prevent blood from clotting, the most common side effect is the risk of bleeding. Taking these medications with coffee is risky since the caffeine in coffee can also slow blood clotting, which further increases your risk of bleeding or bruising.\n\nIn addition, research has found that coffee can lower the pH in your stomach, which can increase the absorption time of other blood thinners like aspirin. Since it’s absorbed faster, more is available to the body all at once, which can enhance the potential for bleeding.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nMany of us look forward to sipping on that first cup of coffee in the morning. While coffee is associated with plenty of health benefits, it’s worth double-checking that it isn’t interfering with any of your medications. Reviewing this list is a good place to start. If you’re on one of these medications, you may need to adjust the timing of your coffee and medications. However, if you have specific questions about potential food or beverage interactions with your medications, be sure to check in with your health care provider.\n\n"

            "full_content": "Metformin may reduce knee pain in overweight patients with osteoarthritis, offering a low-cost alternative to early knee replacement surgery, according to a Monash University trial.\n\nA widely used diabetes medication may help relieve knee osteoarthritis (OA) pain in people who are overweight or obese, potentially delaying the need for knee replacement surgery, according to new research led by Monash University.\n\nThe study, published in JAMA, investigated the effects of metformin, a drug commonly prescribed for type 2 diabetes, on knee pain. Over a six-month period, researchers conducted a randomized clinical trial comparing metformin to a placebo in adults with symptomatic knee OA and no history of diabetes.\n\nConducted entirely via telehealth, the community-based trial enrolled 107 participants (73 women and 34 men) with an average age of 60. Participants received either a daily dose of up to 2000 mg of metformin or a placebo. None had diabetes.\n\nMeasured Impact on Pain Levels\n\nKnee pain was measured on a 0-100 scale, with 100 being the worst. The metformin group reported a 31.3 point reduction in pain after six months, compared to 18.9 for the placebo group. This was considered a moderate effect on pain.\n\n“These results support use of metformin for treatment of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis in people with overweight or obesity,” the researchers found. “Because of the modest sample size, confirmation in a larger clinical trial is warranted.”\n\nLead researcher Professor Flavia Cicuttini, who heads Monash University’s Musculoskeletal Unit and is The Alfred’s Head of Rheumatology, said the results showed that metformin was a potentially new and affordable way to improve knee pain in those with knee OA and overweight or obesity.\n\nKnee OA treatments include lifestyle approaches such as exercise and weight loss, which patients often find difficult, and medications such as paracetamol, topical anti-inflammatory creams, and oral anti-inflammatory medications which have small benefits and may be unsuitable for some patients for safety reasons.\n\nNo new OA drugs have been approved in Australia since Celebrex (celecoxib) and Vioxx (rofecoxib) in the late 1990s.\n\nImplications for Surgery and Healthcare Costs\n\nProfessor Cicuttini said effective treatments that improved knee pain in osteoarthritis were limited. She said this led some patients and their doctors to seek alternative treatments including surgery.\n\nThis resulted in major problems managing knee OA in Australia and internationally, including an increase in the rate of knee replacements performed for earlier stages of OA. This was based on the idea that effective treatments for knee OA were limited and that knee replacements lasted a long time\n\n“At first glance, this may seem reasonable, but it is a major problem because patient dissatisfaction with knee replacements is already high at between 20-30 per cent, even when the operation is technically perfect*,” Professor Cicuttini said. “Dissatisfaction rates are highest when the operation is done for early knee OA.\n\n“To go through the effort and cost of a big operation like a knee replacement, only to be unhappy with the results because of ongoing pain and symptoms, is definitely low-quality care. Doing a knee replacement earlier also increases the potential need for the procedure to be redone.\n\n“This costs about 3.5 times as much, so about $70,000 compared to $20,000, and the results tend not to be as good as the first time. The best outcome for patients is to delay the knee replacements until it is absolutely needed.”\n\nPotential for Broad Implementation\n\nProfessor Cicuttini said metformin now provided GPs an alternative they could offer patients in addition to managing weight and increasing activity. “Metformin works in a number of ways on the knee, including affecting low grade inflammation and other metabolic pathways that are important in knee OA,” she said. “It is a different way to treat knee OA pain.\n\n“GPs are very familiar with metformin, which is a low-cost, safe medication. It could be provided to patients in addition to other treatments they use and has the potential to delay people having knee replacements before they are absolutely needed. If people on metformin have less knee pain and are able to do more physical activity, then knee replacements can wait.”\n\nProfessor Cicuttini and her colleagues are now working with consumers, GPs, orthopaedic surgeons and other healthcare professionals to introduce metformin into the knee OA management pathway in order to improve patient outcomes and potentially better target knee replacements. Metformin could be used ‘off label’ after discussions between patients and their doctor.\n\n“Metformin is safe and well tolerated,” she said. “It is used safely in other non-diabetes conditions such as polycystic ovarian syndrome. Metformin could be provided simply and safely using a telehealth approach, as we did in our study, meaning that it could be provided across the community, including in regional and remote areas.”\n\nAbout knee osteoarthritis (OA)\n\nEffective therapy for knee OA is limited, with a growing international trend toward knee replacements on patients with even milder cases[1], despite recommendations that surgery be reserved for symptomatic end-stage OA[2]. This trend has been partly explained by the lack of effective treatments for knee OA and improved longevity of knee replacements.\n\nOther research has found pain is an ‘omni- present’ feature of knee osteoarthritis and perceived to interrupt and deter daily activities such as walking, making people less confident in their bodies[3]. Current guidelines leave the timing and patient appropriateness for surgery to the discretion of the treating clinicians[4]. However, a systematic review and meta-analysis provided consistent evidence that mild radiological OA was a major contributor to the 20-30% patient dissatisfaction with knee replacements, including persisting pain[5].\n\nAbout metformin\n\nMetformin is a safe, inexpensive, well-tolerated oral medication that has been first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes for more than 60 years. Metformin reduces the production of glucose produced and released by the liver, insulin resistance, and low blood-sugar levels. It causes modest weight loss and reduces inflammation in people with and without diabetes. Other effects of metformin, such as anti-inflammatory properties, and improved glucose and lipid metabolism, such as reduced insulin resistance, may reduce knee pain in osteoarthritis[6].\n\nReference: “Metformin for Knee Osteoarthritis in Patients With Overweight or Obesity: A Randomized Clinical Trial” by Feng Pan, Yuanyuan Wang, Yuan Z.

            "full_content": "Since 2017, a particularly dangerous strain of E. coli O157:H7 has emerged across the country to spark outbreaks, severe disease, and deaths. It spreads in various ways: via leafy greens and contaminated beef, like its relatives, but also recreational waters. Hundreds of people across 46 states have been infected, and health officials have documented at least nine separate outbreaks. One in 2018, linked to lettuce, caused over 200 infections across 37 states, killing five people and causing a severe kidney condition in 26.\n\nNow, a sweeping genetic analysis by researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests a tiny mutation in one of the bacteria's molecular weapons may be behind the strain's rise. The finding, published recently in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, provides insights into this clinically significant plague and its rise to prominence. It also highlights the role of the bacteria's sophisticated military tactics.\n\nThe mutated weapon is part of a complex system that E. coli and other harmful bacteria sometimes use called a Type 3 Secretion System (T3SS). This involves molecular machinery that basically functions like a syringe, complete with a long needle that is poked into the cells of its victims. The T3SS then directly injects a fleet of hostile proteins. Those proteins—called effectors—attack specific targets that collectively disable the host's defense responses and make the host more hospitable for its bacterial conqueror.\n\nThe mutation the CDC researchers found was in one of these T3SS effectors, a protein called EspW. Previous research suggests that this effector is responsible for buttressing a host cell's structure during an invasion, keeping the cell from contracting while enabling the bacteria to become attached to it. A related protein in the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, called HopW1, also disrupts normal cellular structure and processes that would otherwise restrict the ability of P. syringae to cause an infection."
