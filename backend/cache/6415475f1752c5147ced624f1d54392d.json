{"text_length": 2515, "summary": "Nintendo\u2019s delayed Switch 2 preorders finally kicked off in the US at 12AM ET on Thursday. Target seemed to open first, but trying to order was rough. Many of us were able to get to the checkout screen, but ran into issues from there. Best Buy, which promised to launch preorders at 12AM ET, showed a gray \u201ccoming soon\u201d button on the Switch 2 and Mario Kart World bundle pack for about 30 minutes. Walmart\u2019s website, for me, had a vague queue for a long time. Like with Target, Walmart eventually showed a handful of the consoles and bundles in stock here and there before they both sold out. Nintendo announced that preorders will start on April 24th in the US. Preorders started earlier this month in some other territories, including the UK. The preorder problems follow Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa issuing a supply warning in Japan on Wednesday.", "timestamp": "2025-04-25 10:36:27"}
