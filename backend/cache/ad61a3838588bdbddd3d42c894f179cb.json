{"text_length": 2012, "summary": "Now, a sweeping genetic analysis by researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests a tiny mutation in one of the bacteria's molecular weapons may be behind the strain's rise. Those proteins\u2014called effectors\u2014attack specific targets that collectively disable the host's defense responses and make the host more hospitable for its bacterial conqueror. The mutated weapon is part of a complex system that E. coli and other harmful bacteria sometimes use called a Type 3 Secretion System (T3SS).", "timestamp": "2025-05-16 14:29:22"}
