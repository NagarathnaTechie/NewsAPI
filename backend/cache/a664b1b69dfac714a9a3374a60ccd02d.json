Because many of the most common diseases share the same risk factors,\u201d said Jonathan Rosand MD MSc, Founder of the Global Brain Care Coalition and the JP Kistler Endowed Chair in Neurology at MGH. Of these, high blood pressure and severe kidney disease had the biggest impact on the incidence and burden of stroke, dementia, and late-life depression. The results of a comprehensive systematic review reinforce the evidence supporting tools like the Brain Care Score in reducing the risk of age-related brain diseases.", "timestamp": "2025-04-25 11:05:10"}
