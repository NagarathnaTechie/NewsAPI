{"text_length": 2395, "summary": "By imaging the sun\u2019s outer atmosphere and the space between Earth and the sun, PUNCH helps scientists better understand how solar activity shapes our space environment. While PSP collects direct measurements inside the solar corona, PUNCH uses imaging techniques to observe how the corona extends and interacts with space near Earth. Together, these missions provide a fuller understanding of solar dynamics from the sun\u2019s surface to the far reaches of the heliosphere.", "timestamp": "2025-05-19 14:31:29"}
