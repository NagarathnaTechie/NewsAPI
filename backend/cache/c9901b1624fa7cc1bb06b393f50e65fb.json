{"text_length": 2901, "summary": "Earlier in the week, after Leo\u2019s first quip about not wanting to invite him, Sinner said it was \u201ca good thing for us tennis players\u201d that the new pope likes to play the sport. \u201cWe hope to embrace the Holy Father again soon, maybe on a tennis court.\u201d\n\nThe pope and Sinner posed for photos in front of the Davis Cup trophy that Sinner helped Italy win for the second consecutive time last year. Leo, the first American pope, is an avid tennis player and fan and had said earlier this week that he would be up for a charity match when it was suggested by a journalist. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor,\u201d Sinner said in Italian as he and his parents arrived in a reception room of the Vatican\u2019s auditorium. But the pope looked around at the antiques and said, \u201cBetter not.\u201d\n\nLeo, a 69-year-old from Chicago, then appeared to joke about his white cassock and its appropriateness for Wimbledon, perhaps a reference to the All England Club\u2019s all-white clothing rule.", "timestamp": "2025-05-16 14:29:58"}
