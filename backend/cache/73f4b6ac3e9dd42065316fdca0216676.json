I look forward to making a bunch of other kind of movies with you, I can\u2019t wait.\u201d\n\nCruise and Paramount are surely hoping \u201cThe Final Reckoning\u201d follows in the footsteps of \u201cTop Gun: Maverick,\u201d which dazzled Cannes in 2022 and earned a five-minute standing ovation on its way $1.46 billion at the worldwide box office that summer. The film is directed by Christopher McQuarrie, who helmed three previous \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d movies. But one can never doubt Cruise\u2019s ability to deliver a blockbuster. Tom Cruise said goodbye to the \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d franchise in electrifying fashion at the Cannes Film Festival, where \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning\u201d earned a five-minute ovation thanks in part to Cruise\u2019s commitment to putting breathless and death-defying practical stunts on the big screen. I got to grow up and have my very own action figure.\u201d\n\nMcQuarrie then passed the mic to Cruise.
