He also pointed to Kaplan\u2019s February claim that Meta \u201cwon\u2019t shy away\u201d from asking the Trump administration to defend the U.S. tech sector against EU rules. While top tech CEOs have publicly cozied up to the administration \u2014 and in some cases appealed directly to the president \u2014 the Trump administration continues to press forward its antitrust cases against Meta, Apple and other tech giants.", "timestamp": "2025-04-25 11:40:09"}
