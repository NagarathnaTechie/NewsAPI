{"text_length": 2697, "summary": "It's still not clear if Apple will approve Fortnite for the U.S. \u200cApp Store\u200c, because the Epic Games vs. Apple lawsuit made it clear that Apple was well within its rights to terminate Epic's account, and does not have an obligation to allow Fortnite into the \u200cApp Store\u200c. Apple banned the \u200cEpic Games\u200c developer account back in 2020 when \u200cEpic Games\u200c violated its \u200cApp Store\u200c rules to add web-based purchases, kicking off a multi-year legal battle. Apple's App Review guidelines suggest that 90 percent of \u200cApp Store\u200c submissions are reviewed in less than 24 hours, but it's clear that Fortnite's return to the \u200cApp Store\u200c is not straightforward for Apple.", "timestamp": "2025-05-16 14:45:22"}
