Effects of inflammation on motivational deficits in patients with depression are associated with disruptions in corticostriatal reward circuitry involving the inferior ventral striatum (iVS) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). For example, previous studies of medications targeting inflammation in patients with schizophrenia have largely failed by not identifying which patients would benefit from these approaches. Published in Neuropsychopharmacology, the official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology, the study found that higher levels of C-reactive protein \u2014 a blood biomarker of inflammation produced by the liver \u2014 were associated with reduced activity in brain circuits tied to reward and motivation. Negative symptoms and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were obtained in 57 individuals with schizophrenia. The work helped lay the foundation for a current experimental-medicine trial at Emory testing the anti-inflammatory drug infliximab, commonly used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, in patients with schizophrenia who have high inflammation and motivational deficits.
