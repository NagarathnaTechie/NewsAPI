{"text_length": 3707, "summary": "He worked 17 1/3 innings out of the Texas bullpen after the trade. Assuming he hasn\u2019t suffered any kind of undisclosed injury, they could attempt to outright him to the minors. Last year\u2019s strong numbers in Triple-A could get him some attention on the waiver wire. There hasn\u2019t been any indication of an injury, but Pennington hasn\u2019t made any regular season appearances in the minors. Pennington has two minor league option years remaining. Texas initially optioned him to Triple-A but reassigned him to the complex before Opening Day. The roster shuffling squeezes out Pennington, who made 15 relief appearances for Texas last year. Texas will have five days to trade Pennington or place him on waivers.", "timestamp": "2025-04-25 12:11:02"}
