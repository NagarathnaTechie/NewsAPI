Ben Starr, who voices the mysterious Verso in the game, says it's exciting to be living in a year where there are so many games to play. Sandfall Interactive has just 30 developers. Expedition 33 is a new IP that doesn't come along very often, says Starr. He says he's looking forward to playing the game. Starr also confirmed that he'll be diving into Oblivion in the future. He said: \"What a great year for videogames\" Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is the best-reviewed game of 2025 so far. With a Metacritic score of 92, it's tied with Blue Prince for the best game of the year. Our own review calls it \"a phenomenal RPG\" that \"reinterprets familiar mechanics with an imaginative eye\"", "timestamp": "2025-04-25 10:39:28"}
