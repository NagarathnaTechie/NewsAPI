Advertisement:\n\nOffensively, Kornet got plenty of help from Brown, Derrick White and Jrue Holiday, but the Celtics held the Knicks to 17 points in the quarter in large part because they could not get anything going near the rim. \u201cI unfortunately was a little tired and didn\u2019t have my usual wit and charm.\u201d\n\nKristaps Porzingis was the exact opposite\n\nGoing forward, the Celtics will also need to consider to what extent Porzingis can be part of the rotation \u2013 in stark contrast to Kornet, Porzingis played 12 minutes and was -12 in a game the Celtics won by 25 points. The Celtics are a championship-caliber team oozing with playoff experience and championship-quality mental strength, which is what made it so stunning that they went down 2-0 at home against the Knicks in the first place. We did that tonight, and we\u2019ve got to try to find a way to win Game 6.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe Celtics showed their mettle. That strategy has now worked against both Brunson and Towns at various times in the series, and as the Celtics look ahead to a Game 6 that few thought they would see, they will need to consider how they can make both players work as much as possible on the defensive end. In two of those games, the Celtics shot their worst games all year, and on Wednesday, they built a 20-plus point lead without Tatum. \u201cSo we kind of have to play a little differently and just find ways to create offense, to rebound, just everything he does on the court. He wasn\u2019t always rewarded with an assist \u2013 one of the Celtics\u2019 best plays of the game started when Brown collapsed the defense and ended with Kornet sliding to the rim for an open pick-and-roll dunk several passes later. Wednesday\u2019s game wasn\u2019t just a team fighting for pride after its star went down \u2013 the Celtics were the better, more fundamental team. The rest of Brown\u2019s game is what propelled the Celtics forward and kept their season alive. We haven\u2019t won anything yet, just gotta find a way to go to New York and win a game.\u201d\n\nWhite\u2019s 3-point shooting was excellent, but he also went to the free-throw line 11 times. Advertisement:\n\nBut Brown\u2019s biggest contributions may have come on the defensive end, where he took on the task of guarding Jalen Brunson and hounded the Knicks\u2019 guard into a very tough game. However, Tatum\u2019s injury ensured that the Celtics won\u2019t be fully healthy for the foreseeable future.", "timestamp": "2025-05-16 14:29:56"}
