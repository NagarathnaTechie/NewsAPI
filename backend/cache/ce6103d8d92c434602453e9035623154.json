Future studies will explore whether women with a history of schistosomiasis are more likely to develop cervical cancer due to long-term HPV infections. So, these changes in the cervix could open the door to cancer-causing viral infections. How the worm raises cervical cancer risk\n\nIn summary, when the parasite's eggs become lodged in cervical tissue, they provoke a strong inflammatory response, Mertelsmann told Live Science in an email. \"At least shortly after treatment, the elimination of the S. haematobium might at least transiently increase the risk for oncogenesis,\" or cancer growth, Mertelsmann told Live Science. A parasite that infects millions across Africa may quietly prime the cervix for cancer \u2014 and, surprisingly, a standard treatment for the infection could amplify that risk, new research hints. To investigate how the worm might affect the cervix, researchers analyzed tissue samples from 39 women in Tanzania \u2014 20 with active infections and 19 without. It may raise the risk of cervical cancer, a study has found. In addition to the carcinogenic effects of the eggs, the infection triggers repeated cycles of injury and healing that can lead to abnormal tissue growth, Mertelsmann said in an email.", "timestamp": "2025-04-25 11:05:16"}
