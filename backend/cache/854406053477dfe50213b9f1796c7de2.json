{"text_length": 8333, "summary": "\"Much less likely is a new start for the next big observatory to come after JWST, the Habitable Worlds Observatory, which is more of a true replacement for Hubble\u2019s UV and visible light capabilities.\" The biggest threat to the future of Hubble doesn't come from other space telescopes like the JWST and Rubin, but rather from an internal challenge that jeopardizes those missions too. From left to right Hubble, the JWST and the Roman Space Telecope (Image credit: NASA/ESA)\n\nThe long-serving space telescope could be particularly useful when collaborating with future ground-based observatories, including the Vera Rubin Observatory on Cerro Pach\u00f3n in Chile, which is currently nearing completion. \"While Hubble and JWST are designed to provide exquisite spatial resolution of targets along a tight, pencil-beam type line of sight, the Rubin Observatory will scan the sky in fields of view a few times larger than the full moon, night after night, detecting all sorts of new things,\" Retherford said. Poulain also suggested that even though Hubble may one day be surpassed by other telescopes like the JWST and the European Space Agency's Euclid spacecraft, there is another key aspect keeping Hubble relevant: familiarity. Let's hope Hubble can hang on until its true replacement and NASA's next big mission after Roman, the Habitable Worlds Observatory, can get off the ground, or maybe until its 40th birthday in 2030? \"Hubble is an easy choice, as people do know what to expect from Hubble observations and how to handle them. Roman has been designed to complement the high resolution and sensitivity of the JWST, thus building on the success of that telescope and Hubble. \"They both have a similar field of view and spatial resolution, and they are complementary in terms of filters used: Hubble offers a view in the optical, while the JWST observes in near-infrared and infrared bands.\" \"I hope Hubble keeps working until our Europa Clipper and JUICE [Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer] missions to Jupiter's moons arrive and operate in the 2030 to 2036 timeframe so that we can coordinate observations.", "timestamp": "2025-04-25 11:05:31"}
