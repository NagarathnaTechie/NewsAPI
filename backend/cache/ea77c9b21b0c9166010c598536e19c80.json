{"text_length": 12411, "summary": "I expect the Eagles to be interested in a cornerback in this draft. He brings the Lions youth and depth on the defensive line as a stout run defender. They can address the defensive line in the deeper rounds of this draft. The Cardinals have hosted several defensive linemen on pre-draft visits, but in this scenario, I believe they would take a swing on a true CB1 in Will Johnson \u2014 another top-30 visitor. Even with Malaki Starks on the board, I think it\u2019s going to be an edge rusher \u2014 Williams, Mike Green or James Pearce Jr. in this scenario. If the Ravens don\u2019t select an edge rusher in the first round, their odds of getting an impact player at that position decrease significantly. Yet, they\u2019ll need to add to their receiver room, even with the Davante Adams addition. Use code DRAFT25 for an offseason win. Burden could be a dynamic yards-after-the-catch player for this offense. The Texans brought Jackson (and Grey Zabel) in for a top-30 visit, and he feels like a player they would take here. It\u2019s fair to question whether the Falcons would keep investing in the defensive line after last year\u2019s draft haul, but Stewart\u2019s rare blend of size and explosiveness could prove too tempting to pass up. The Lions\u2018 first four picks from the 2024 draft came in for top-30 visits. He\u2019s also a reliable blocker and can be on the field on all downs. I believe the Bucs will be targeting a pass rusher who can consistently win one-on-one matchups and has proven college production. It could have been all health-related, but if they have more concerns, they could be very keen on the cornerback position. I don\u2019t think the Steelers force a quarterback selection, but if Sanders is there, he should be the pick. I believe the Jaguars are leaning toward selecting an offensive playmaker with their first pick, with plans to address the trenches in later rounds. The Colts tend to favor prospects who combine high-end athleticism with elite length \u2014 and that\u2019s Campbell. I don\u2019t think Sanders will be a top-10 pick, even after posting elite PFF passing grades over the last two seasons. Egbuka has the skill set the Broncos want in a receiver, as he can play all three receiver alignments and took plenty of backfield handoffs on sweeps. The Packers need to upgrade their wide receiver room, both short- and long-term. If not, a sneaky pick here is LSU tight end Mason Taylor. He\u2019s one of just three blue-chip prospects in the class, and adding him gives Jacksonville a dynamic run game to build around.", "timestamp": "2025-04-25 11:05:51"}
