{"text_length": 4300, "summary": "\u201cWithout plastics, it would be impossible to meet our climate change goals \u2014 plastics make cars lighter, enable solar and wind energy, reduce food waste, and improve energy efficiency in buildings.\u201d\n\nHow plastic disrupts the carbon cycle\n\nOn the surface of the ocean, tiny plankton absorb carbon dioxide into their bodies as they photosynthesize. \u201cBut as far as how much \u2026 we\u2019re still trying to figure it out.\u201d\n\nIn the soil, plastic changes the way microbes store and release carbon, which could also warm the planet, although Kaufman said there\u2019s not enough research yet to say how much. Kaufman and her co-authors acknowledge that more research is needed to determine how much bigger plastic\u2019s contribution to climate change might be. How plastics may affect the Earth\u2019s reflectivity\n\nNormally, light-colored and reflective surfaces such as snow, ice and clouds reflect the sun\u2019s energy back into space, keeping the Earth from warming up too much.", "timestamp": "2025-05-16 14:29:22"}
