Breathwork activates calming signals across brain circuits. \u201cMaybe not everyone, but a lot of people will find that to be beneficial, and to me, that\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nAbout this breathwork and neuroscience research news\n\nAuthor: Will Houston\n\nSource: UCLA\n\nContact: Will Houston \u2013 UCLA\n\nImage: The image is credited to Neuroscience News People new to breathwork should start with something less intense, Dr. Feldman suggested: \u201cDon\u2019t go out and run a marathon when you\u2019ve been sitting on the couch.\u201d\n\nThe Wim Hof Method and a similar technique, Holotropic Breathwork, can lead to altered states of consciousness, which both Lindqvist and Dr. Feldman described as \u201cpsychedelic.\u201d\n\nThis \u2013 and the tingling physical sensations \u2013 likely results from changes in carbon dioxide levels caused by hyperventilation, Dr. Feldman explained. Source: UCLA\n\nBreathwork \u2013 intentionally changing breathing patterns to improve physical, mental or emotional well-being \u2013 may seem woo-woo, but the science behind the practice is sound, says Jack Feldman, PhD, a professor of neurobiology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. But one doesn\u2019t need to understand how breath affects the brain to benefit from breathwork, Dr. Feldman said, \u201cmuch like you can drive a car without understanding how an engine works.\u201d\n\nPracticing common breathing techniques, such as box breathing or 4-7-8 breathing, for a few minutes a day is a great way to start, he said. Some of Dr. Feldman\u2019s recent work has investigated whether the placebo effect contributes to the efficacy of breathwork. \u2026 It\u2019s something we think that evolved early that we ultimately hijacked in terms of breathwork.\u201d\n\nWhat makes breathwork work? In other words, do deep breaths calm us down because we expect them to?", "timestamp": "2025-05-19 14:31:03"}
