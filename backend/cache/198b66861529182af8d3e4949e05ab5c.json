{"text_length": 5232, "summary": "The technology offers several key advantages:\n\nEnhanced understanding of disease progression: RiskPath can map how different risk factors change in importance over time, revealing critical windows for intervention. \"And what those do is help clinicians, and maybe one day patients, be able to understand their risk for a chronic or progressive disease better and earlier,\" she said. \"By identifying high-risk individuals before symptoms appear or early in the disease course and pinpointing which risk factors matter most at different life stages, we can develop more targeted and effective preventive strategies. \"The ultimate aim of RiskPath and tools like RiskPath is to help people build better risk stratification tools and decision support tools. De Lacy and the rest of the research team validated RiskPath across three major long-term patient cohorts involving thousands of participants to successfully predict eight different conditions, including depression, anxiety, ADHD, hypertension and metabolic syndrome. Practical risk visualization: The system provides intuitive visualizations showing which time periods in a person's life contribute most to disease risk, helping researchers identify optimal times for preventive interventions.", "timestamp": "2025-05-19 14:30:55"}
