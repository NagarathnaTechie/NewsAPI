To put the gap in a bit more context, the Switch 2's miniaturized Ampere GPU is rated for 3.072 TFLOPs when docked, versus just 1.71 TFLOPs while undocked. Oddly enough, the Switch 2 CPU clock speed actually increases when the console is played outside the dock.", "timestamp": "2025-05-16 14:30:14"}
