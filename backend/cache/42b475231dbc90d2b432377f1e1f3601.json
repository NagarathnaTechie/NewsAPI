{"text_length": 6252, "summary": "The team wanted to make sure the long-dormant thrusters would be available when the dish is back online briefly in August, by which time the thrusters currently in use on Voyager 1 might be completely clogged. \"I think at that time, the team was OK with accepting that the primary roll thrusters didn't work, because they had a perfectly good backup,\" said Kareem Badaruddin, Voyager mission manager at JPL, which manages the mission for NASA. If, during that time, the spacecraft's star tracker drifted too far from the guide star, the long-dormant roll thrusters would automatically fire (thanks to the spacecraft's programming). It was yet another miracle save for Voyager.\" But on Voyager 1, the primary roll thrusters stopped working in 2004 after losing power in two small internal heaters. But without the ability to control the spacecraft's roll motion, a variety of issues would arise that might threaten the mission, so the engineering team decided to reexamine the 2004 thruster failure. If the test had failed, Voyager might already have been in danger. Because of Voyager's distance, the radio signal takes over 23 hours to travel from the spacecraft to Earth, meaning everything the team saw happening had occurred almost a day earlier.", "timestamp": "2025-05-16 14:29:36"}
