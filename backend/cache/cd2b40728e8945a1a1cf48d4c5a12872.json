With all that in mind, Gebara and her team conducted literature reviews to identify constraints for both healthy diets \u2013 resulting in 32 key nutritional requirements \u2013 and ones which are environmentally sustainable \u2013 based on a number of key thresholds for planetary sustainability.", "timestamp": "2025-04-25 11:05:30"}
