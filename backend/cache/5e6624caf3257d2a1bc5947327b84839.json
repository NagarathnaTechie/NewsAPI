In effect, the NCAA would cede power to enforce regulations tied to improper benefits to this new organization. However, instead of the NCAA being the lawsuit target, individual schools may soon become the focus. House v. NCAA settlement terms If approved, the settlement would resolve three antitrust lawsuits: Carter v. NCAA, House v. NCAA and Hubbard v. NCAA. The NCAA is utilizing a formula based on revenue distribution presented to each league over a nine-year period starting in 2016, which leans heavily on basketball units tied to NCAA Tournament participation, according to Yahoo Sports. The Power Five conferences \u2013 ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12 and SEC \u2013 will pay 24% of the overall damages, followed by the Group of Five at 10%.The FCS is on the hook for 14% and non-football conferences in Division I will pay 12% of the overall agreement, according to documents reviewed by CBS Sports. Each school will split the revenue pie based on its own formulas, meaning a women's basketball player may sue a school if they believe they are not receiving their fair share of cash.", "timestamp": "2025-04-25 11:05:52"}
