All this allowed them to investigate cortisol\u2019s impact at an earlier stage of Alzheimer\u2019s disease pathogenesis, where interventions might be most effective. \u201cOur work shows that considering sex and hormonal status in understanding Alzheimer\u2019s disease pathogenesis is important, and suggests that stress reduction and hormonal interventions may hold promise for Alzheimer\u2019s prevention, especially in at-risk women,\u201d said Sudha Seshadri, founding director of the Biggs Institute and senior author of the study. Cortisol levels were associated with increased amyloid buildup, not tau. \u201cThe results highlight the importance of identifying early risk factors when biomarkers are detectable but cognitive impairment is absent,\u201d said Arash Salardini, MD, associate professor of cognitive and behavioral neurology with the Glenn Biggs Institute for Alzheimer\u2019s and Neurodegenerative Diseases at UT Health San Antonio.

Given the neuroprotective effects of estrogen and testosterone, which mitigate cortisol\u2019s deleterious impact on neural tissues, they also explored sex-specific differences, focusing particularly on post-menopausal risk. Also, several cross-sectional and longitudinal studies had reported that higher blood cortisol levels are linked to an increased likelihood of developing the disease. Genetic studies had identified mutations in glucocorticoid, or steroid hormones that have anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, signaling pathways that increase susceptibility to Alzheimer\u2019s disease.", "timestamp": "2025-05-19 14:31:05"}
