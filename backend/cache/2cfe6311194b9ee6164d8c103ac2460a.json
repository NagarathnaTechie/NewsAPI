{"text_length": 3716, "summary": "However, OOI and the volcano's remote location have made Axial Seamount a crown jewel in the effort to evolve long-term volcano eruption forecasting. Scientists estimate that 80% of volcano eruptions happen underwater, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It inflates to about the same level each time, and then an eruption is triggered. And while scientists predict the eruption will trigger small earthquakes (2s and 3s on the Richter scale), they aren't strong enough to cause major destruction to marine or land life, Chadwick said. When the eruptions happen, some of the vents may get covered by lava, but they reappear as magma reaccumulates in the earth. Forecasting eruptions months and years ahead is much harder to do than days or hours ahead.", "timestamp": "2025-05-16 14:44:33"}
