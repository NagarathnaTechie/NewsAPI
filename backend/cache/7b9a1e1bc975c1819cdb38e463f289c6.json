Science Advances\n\nAbstract\n\nNovel color via stimulation of individual photoreceptors at population scale\n\nWe introduce a principle, Oz, for displaying color imagery: directly controlling the human eye\u2019s photoreceptor activity via cell-by-cell light delivery. Or, by primarily activating the M cone cells, Oz can show people the color olo. Attempting to activate M cones exclusively is shown to elicit a color beyond the natural human gamut, formally measured with color matching by human subjects. With an individual\u2019s cone map in hand, the Oz system can be programmed to rapidly scan a laser beam over a small patch of the retina, delivering tiny pulses of energy when the beam reaches a cone that it wants to activate, and otherwise staying off. Further experiments show that subjects perceive Oz colors in image and video form. \u201cWe\u2019ve created a system that can track, target and stimulate photoreceptor cells with such high precision that we can now answer very basic, but also very thought-provoking, questions about the nature of human color vision,\u201d Fong said. But for a human to actually perceive a whole new color, Ng and Roorda would need to find a way to activate not just one cone cell, but thousands of them. The laser beam is just one color \u2014 the same hue as a green laser pointer \u2014 but by activating a combination of S, M and L cone cells, it can trick the eye into seeing images in full technicolor. \u201cWhen the laser gets jittered, the normal color of the laser almost looks like yellow because the difference is so stark.\u201d\n\nProbing the nature of color vision\n\nOz isn\u2019t just useful for projecting tiny movies into the eye. \u201cIt gives us a way to study the human retina at a new scale that has never been possible in practice.\u201d\n\nThe Oz technique is described in a new study published last week in the journal Science Advances. Theoretically, novel colors are possible through bypassing the constraints set by the cone spectral sensitivities and activating M cone cells exclusively.", "timestamp": "2025-04-25 11:06:06"}
