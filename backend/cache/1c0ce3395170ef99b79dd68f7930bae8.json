{"text_length": 2314, "summary": "The idea that humans glow may seem silly, but this research suggests it\u2019s a measurable biological fact. Injured parts glowed more brightly than healthy ones, which the researchers say is clear evidence that living stress responses drive the emission. The source of the glow is believed to be byproducts of metabolism that sometimes create high-energy reactions capable of releasing light. According to a study published with their findings, the researchers observed a dramatic decrease in photon emissions after death.", "timestamp": "2025-05-16 14:29:38"}
