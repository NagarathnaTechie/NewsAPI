The Role of Deimos and Mars Moons in Planetary Science\n\nDeimos, the smaller and more distant of Mars\u2019 two moons, is an intriguing object due to its irregular shape, tidal locking, and mysterious origin. Deimos against the planet Mars (Credit : NASA)\n\nESA\u2019s Hera Mission: A Complementary Perspective on Deimos\n\nJust days after Perseverance\u2019s Deimos observation, the European Space Agency\u2019s Hera mission conducted a high-speed flyby of Mars on March 12, 2025. This achievement demonstrates the rover\u2019s advanced imaging capabilities and the innovative methods scientists use to study Mars and its moons from the surface. This complements observations from orbiters and flyby missions, enriching our knowledge of how Martian moons interact with the planet and the space environment around them.", "timestamp": "2025-05-19 14:31:29"}
