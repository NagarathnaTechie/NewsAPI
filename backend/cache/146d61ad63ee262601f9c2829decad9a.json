{"text_length": 5110, "summary": "\"So we were pretty sure when we launched Mortal Kombat 1 that we were going to be doing years of content, and this is year two.\" We'll just have to wait and see what's next for Mortal Kombat and for NetherRealm Studios in general. At this point, it hasn't been outright confirmed that there will be no more DLC for Mortal Kombat 1, but considering NetherRealm Studios' history of doing this with previous games, it feels like a final nail in the coffin for any hopes. Could it finally be time for that Mortal Kombat remastered collection? Shortly after the reveal of Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns, Ed Boon mentioned more plans for the game's future. However, it's important to note that Mortal Kombat 1 was originally released on September 14, 2023. We even saw an incomplete render of Kung Jin for Mortal Kombat 1, which seemingly added additional validity to these rumors. With all of that said, we've already heard from Ed Boon himself that NetherRealm Studios has already planned out their next game for a long time now.", "timestamp": "2025-05-19 14:32:07"}
