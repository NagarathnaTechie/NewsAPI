This combination gave them one of the most detailed global maps ever created of sporadic E activity during and after a major solar storm. This propagation characteristic from high to low latitudes suggests that sporadic E layers are most likely caused by the disturbed neutral winds in the E region.\u201d\n\nUnderstanding the activity of the E layer is vital due to its potential to disrupt radio communications in the HF and VHF bands. During a powerful solar storm on Mother\u2019s Day, scientists discovered that a mysterious ionospheric phenomenon, sporadic E layers, became unusually active, especially during the storm\u2019s recovery. The research team hopes that their new findings will lead to better insights on Es layer activity and how such unique phenomena are created in the ionosphere.", "timestamp": "2025-05-19 14:31:24"}
