Metabolic syndrome can lead to inflammation, and \u201cwhen someone has inflammation in the body and in the brain, it can fast-forward aging,\u201d Isaacson said. And finally, he noted that metabolic syndrome may affect the brain\u2019s ability to metabolize energy, which may lead to cognitive impairment. Treatment for metabolic syndrome, which can also increase the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular conditions, starts with lifestyle changes, said Dr. Pam Taub, a preventive cardiologist and professor of medicine at the University of California San Diego. \u201cI think this study gives us more evidence to suggest that these brain-healthy choices may lead to better brain outcomes over time.\u201d\n\nCausation vs. correlation\n\nIt is important to note that the study was observational, which means that researchers can\u2019t say that metabolic syndrome caused dementia, only that there was a correlation between the two, Isaacson said. \u201cYou have to synergize both lifestyle and pharmacology.\u201d Researchers analyzed the markers of metabolic syndrome and who developed young-onset dementia between 2009 and the end of 2020, according to the study published Wednesday in the journal Neurology.", "timestamp": "2025-04-25 11:05:14"}
