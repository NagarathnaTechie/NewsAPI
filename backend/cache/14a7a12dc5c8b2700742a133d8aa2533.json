{"text_length": 6221, "summary": "\"I am hopeful that this pioneering research will motivate women who are not currently engaged in regular physical activity to understand that they are in a position to gain tremendous benefit for each increment of regular exercise they are able to invest in their longer-term health,\" Dr. Christine Albert , chair of the Department of Cardiology in the Smidt Heart Institute who was not involved in the study, said in the statement. Compared with inactive individuals, women who performed aerobic physical activity had a 36% lower cardiovascular mortality risk, while for active men, this risk reduction was about 14%. \"What surprised us the most was the fact that women who do muscle strengthening had a reduction in their cardiovascular mortality by 30%,\" Gulati told NPR . On average, the women who strength-trained at least twice a week had a 19% lower mortality risk than women who trained less often or not at all. Women also gained these survival benefits much more quickly than men did, the study found. In men, the highest reduction in death risk was seen at about 300 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per week. In addition, the study didn't account for potentially unassessed health issues in some participants, or changes in people's exercise trends over time. But scientists have discovered that that reduction in risk may differ between the sexes, with some people reaping greater benefits in less workout time.", "timestamp": "2025-05-19 14:31:00"}
