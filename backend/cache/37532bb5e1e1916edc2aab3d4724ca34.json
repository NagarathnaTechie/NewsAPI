In a recent interview, Nintendo\u2019s senior vice president of product development Nate Bihldorff spoke about how Mario Kart World is \u201cone of the most broadly accessible games possible.\u201d Also, anyone can easily get into the game, but it also has a high skill ceiling \u2013 meaning it\u2019s very appealing to both hardcore and casual players. So to my mind, not only does Mario Kart 8 clearly demonstrate that there\u2019s a lot of appetite for racing games, broadly speaking, because it sold very well over the course the entire Switch generation, but really, it comes back to that idea that this is a game that really is going to satisfy any kind of Nintendo gamer.", "timestamp": "2025-05-19 14:32:09"}
