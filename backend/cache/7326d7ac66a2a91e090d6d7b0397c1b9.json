{"text_length": 3803, "summary": "In addition to Jeremiah, Todd McShay, Peter Schrager, and Mike Mayock (on the Rich Eisen Show) each have the Giants trading up into the second half of the first round for Jaxson Dart after selecting Abdul Carter. This is the expected move at this point and we\u2019re pretty much at the point where the Giants doing anything other than taking Abdul Carter would be a stunner. As Jeremiah details, Dart makes a lot of sense as a developmental quarterback for the Giants from a traits perspective. New York Giants - Abdul Carter, EDGE, Penn State\n\nThere\u2019s been chatter about the Giants potentially trading out of this pick, but if they stay put, I think they address the defensive line. So that does keep the possibility open, however the Giants would likely need a really good haul to move out of this pick. New York Giants - Jaxson Dart, QB, Ole Miss\n\nThe Giants and Browns are both candidates to trade back into the first round, with the goal of moving ahead of the QB-needy Steelers.", "timestamp": "2025-04-25 11:05:53"}
