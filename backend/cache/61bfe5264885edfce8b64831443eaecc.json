Matthew Boyd really wasn\u2019t all that bad, but the Dodgers (not unlike the Cubs) are just going to wring every last little bit out of you. Julian Merryweather has been mostly really boring this year, and that\u2019s the best compliment I can give a 2025 Cubs reliever. Pete Crow-Armstrong is the Ankin Law \u201cMaking it Personal\u201d Player of the Game for his four RBI night, with another homer and two singles (and two stolen bases). The Dodgers scored, the Cubs scored back.", "timestamp": "2025-04-25 11:05:52"}
