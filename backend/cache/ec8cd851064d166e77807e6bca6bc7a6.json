The study suggests that what women eat in their 40s and 50s can impact their health decades later. Whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes gave women a better shot at aging well. \u201cStudies are starting to find an association between food choices in midlife and quality of life in later years. For the women in this study, eating well decades earlier paid off in a big way. They\u2019re linked to lower risks of chronic diseases, sharper minds, and better physical health in old age. Women who upped their intake of high-quality carbs by 10% had a 31% better chance of aging well. It connected their midlife eating habits to their health in their 70s and 80s. But it\u2019s not just about eating fewer carbs. High-quality carbs and dietary fiber aren\u2019t just good for digestion. But once the researchers factored in fiber intake, that connection weakened. The more we can understand about healthy aging, the more science can help people live healthier for longer,\u201d Korat said. Aging doesn\u2019t have to mean decline, and it doesn\u2019t have to mean slowing down. What this means for women\n\nAging well isn\u2019t just about avoiding illness. Women who did had 8% to 16% better odds of aging well.", "timestamp": "2025-05-19 14:30:59"}
