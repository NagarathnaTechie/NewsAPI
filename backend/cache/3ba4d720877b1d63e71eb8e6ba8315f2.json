{"text_length": 7046, "summary": "Rory McIlroy gathered no momentum after making the cut on the number and is tied for 49th at 2 over, 13 shots behind Scheffler. This golf course is tricky, and one shot is nothing.\u201d\n\nNobody could attest to Quail Hollow\u2019s treachery, particularly in the final three-hole stretch, more than DeChambeau. His drive on the 14th hole may end up the shot of the tournament, a 3-wood drawing into the breeze that landed on the apron, bounded on to the green and rolled to inside a yard. Behind the 11th green, McIlroy\u2019s second of the day, one fan, perhaps after one too many Wicked Weed IPAs, shouted upon seeing McIlroy approach the ropes, \u201cScottie Scheffler!\u201d\n\n\u201cI get mistaken for a lot of people,\u201d McIlroy said, chuckling along with the gallery. After he made a second straight birdie on No. Then he pulled a 9-iron on the 187-yard 17th hole and struck it \u201cexactly how I wanted to,\u201d he said. DeChambeau, ever golf\u2019s main character, led alone at 8 under after consecutive birdies on Nos. He missed the first, which Scheffler said was set up with his best shot of the day \u2014 a 198-yard 7-iron off a sidehill lie with wind whipping straight across. Rahm, the titan who disappeared from major contention after defecting for LIV Golf at the outset of 2024, tied for the lead at one point and finished at 6 under, five back of Scheffler and tied for fifth. Scot-tie!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could hit two good shots and not end up with birdie chances,\u201d Scheffler said. His potential run at a Grand Slam was all but snuffed out. Advertisement\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why golf is the worst four-letter word in the world,\u201d DeChambeau said. He finished tied for 45th at last year\u2019s Masters, missed the cut at the PGA and withdrew from the U.S. Open with a foot injury.", "timestamp": "2025-05-19 14:31:44"}
