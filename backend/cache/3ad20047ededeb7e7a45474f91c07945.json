{"text_length": 4287, "summary": "Intuitive Machines' Athena moon lander as photographed by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter on March 10, 2025. \"We've expanded onboard terrain crater database for enhanced navigation across the surface of the moon.\" Intuitive Machines is working hard to ensure that its next moon lander \u2014 the vehicle that will launch on the IM-3 mission in 2026 \u2014 can stay on its feet. Athena, the second lunar lander built and operated by Houston company Intuitive Machines, fell onto its side shortly after touching down near the lunar south pole on March 6. Athena carried a suite of NASA science instruments and several other payloads, including Intuitive Machines' hopping spacecraft \"Grace\" and the MAPP rover, from the Colorado company Lunar Outpost. The team is also feeding the detailed south pole imagery captured during IM-2 into machine-learning algorithms to improve future missions' navigation and crater-tracking abilities.", "timestamp": "2025-05-16 14:29:35"}
