{"text_length": 2977, "summary": "The internet is making fun of Max for changing its name to HBO Max (for the second time). Discovery distributed this meme to the media when it announced it was changing the name of its streaming service back to HBO Max. While WBD put out a relatively straight press release today about the rebrand, the company distributed a meme to go along with it, as my colleague Peter Kafka, who dove into the business implications of the rebrand, pointed out.
