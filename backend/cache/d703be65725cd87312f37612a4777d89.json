{"text_length": 4074, "summary": "Of the participants, 61% experienced fatigue two weeks after the mini-stroke, and 54% experienced fatigue at each of the three other testing time periods at three, six, and 12 months. This could help us better understand who might struggle with fatigue long-term and require further care.\u201d\n\nA limitation of the study was that while participants were asked to complete the questionnaires themselves, it is possible some responses may have been completed with assistance from relatives or caretakers, and this may have influenced responses, including those around fatigue.

Why Ongoing Monitoring Matters\n\n\u201cLong-term fatigue was common in our group of study participants, and we found that if people experience fatigue within two weeks after leaving the hospital, it is likely they will continue to have fatigue for up to a year,\u201d said Modrau. Researchers looked at how many participants experienced fatigue, as defined as a score of 12 or higher.", "timestamp": "2025-05-16 14:44:13"}
