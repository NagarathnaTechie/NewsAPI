{"text_length": 4110, "summary": "The virus has been linked to mass die-offs of blackbirds elsewhere in Europe, though that doesn't seem to be the case in Britain. Usutu virus was first detected more than half a century ago around southern Africa's Usutu River It has since spread around the world, reaching Europe three decades ago, and was picked up for the first time in the UK in 2020 Blackbirds are particularly susceptible to the virus, which can also infect horses and, from time to time, humans. New data shows Usutu has spread across much of southern England in five years, and has been linked to declines in some blackbird populations. Diseases such as Usutu are a growing threat to wild birds, amid a host of other pressures, including habitat loss, climate change and pesticide use. And the blackbird remains one of the commonest garden birds with numbers holding steady in many parts of the country, especially in rural areas, and in the north.", "timestamp": "2025-05-16 14:29:19"}
