{"text_length": 3453, "summary": "Beyond AI, Google may talk about updates to its other products including GMail, Chrome and the Play Store, although whether these updates are big enough to be discussed during the keynote rather than as part of the developer-focused sessions following I/O's opening remains to be seen. Gemini: With Android being spun out into its own separate event, Google is evidently clearing the way for I/O to focus on everything else the company does. What to expect from Google I/O 2025\n\nLittle chat about Android 16: As Google gave Android 16 its own outing already, it's likely that it won't be mentioned all that much during I/O. AI will continue to dominate the conversation at I/O, just as it did last year (though hopefully Google can make it more understandable) with updates to many of its AI platforms expected to be announced.", "timestamp": "2025-05-19 14:32:04"}
