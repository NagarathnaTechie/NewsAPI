{"text_length": 3648, "summary": "\"Flares of this magnitude are not frequent,\" they note, adding \"users of high frequency (HF) radio signals may experience temporary degradation or complete loss of signal on much of the sunlit side of Earth.\" When a strong enough solar flare occurs, ionization is produced in the lower, more dense layers of the ionosphere (the D-layer), and radio waves that interact with electrons in layers lose energy due to the more frequent collisions that occur in the higher density environment of the D-layer. However, an M-class solar flare occurred shortly afterwards, and part of this could collide with Earth, potentially bringing aurora with it. The X2.7 flare, released at 08:25 AM UTC on May 14, is not expected to have produced a CME that will collide with Earth, according to the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center. \"C-class flares are too weak to noticeably affect Earth.", "timestamp": "2025-05-16 14:29:36"}
