{"text_length": 5754, "summary": "What Comes Next for Jovian Auroras\n\nThe team now plans to study this discrepancy between the Hubble and Webb data and to explore the wider implications for Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere and space environment. We still don\u2019t understand how this happens.\u201d\n\nThese observations of Jupiter\u2019s auroras at a wavelength of 3.36 microns (F335M) were captured with Webb\u2019s NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) on December 25, 2023. They also intend to follow up this research with more Webb observations, which they can compare with data from NASA\u2019s Juno spacecraft to better explore the cause of the enigmatic bright emission. NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope has captured new details of the auroras on our solar system\u2019s largest planet. Led by Jonathan Nichols at the University of Leicester in the UK, the research team discovered rapidly changing features in Jupiter\u2019s auroras, revealing a level of activity that\u2019s far more dynamic than scientists expected. Thanks to Webb\u2019s incredible sensitivity, astronomers are now able to study these lights in greater detail to better understand Jupiter\u2019s powerful magnetic environment. When these and other solar particles are swept up by Jupiter\u2019s magnetic field, they\u2019re accelerated to extreme speeds and collide with the planet\u2019s atmosphere, creating bursts of glowing light. These glowing light shows are not only massive but also hundreds of times brighter than Earth\u2019s auroras.", "timestamp": "2025-05-16 14:29:33"}
