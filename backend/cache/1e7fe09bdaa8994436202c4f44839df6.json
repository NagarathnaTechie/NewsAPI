{"text_length": 6467, "summary": "Panpsychism alarms some thinkers who worry that ascribing feeling to atoms cheapens the concept of consciousness. Wherever the search leads, it forces us to face an unsettling possibility: consciousness might be less a rare jewel than a basic note in the cosmic score. If experience is not tacked onto matter but rides with it from the start, the gap between mind and world may shrink. Quantum puzzles and panpsychism\n\nA more controversial route links mind to quantum mechanics. Yet the framework has already inspired machine-consciousness tests, raising practical as well as philosophical stakes. Interest in the idea has surged again as researchers wrestle with the \u201chard problem of consciousness,\u201d the stubborn mystery of how physical stuff gives rise to subjective feeling. So far, definitive evidence for Orch-OR is missing, but the debate keeps the link between physics and consciousness on the table. If IIT holds up, panpsychism gains a scientific foothold, because the theory does not limit consciousness to biology. Neuroscientists are refining \u03a6-based metrics, while physicists hunt quantum signatures in biology. Science meets philosophy today\n\nModern neuroscience attacks the mystery head-on.", "timestamp": "2025-05-19 14:31:26"}
